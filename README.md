# gpt4o-ai-assistant
Creating an AI Assistant with GPT4o 

This code is a Datalab tutorial to build a GPT-4o assistant using few academic papers to give definition and estimates of development for Artificial General Intelligence. 

Later on, I had a limit of 30k tokens when trying GPT-4o and changed to GPT-4o-mini in order to make it work.

Added an API to used the assistant created
